# In this folder I will be posting random codes during my education.
As of 10/02/2022 I am stuck on Hw 5- Logistic Regression classification using 2 features. Cost function is blowing up to NaN when trying to calculate.
Currently practicing how to use git and features along with that. Will be learning ML along the way and possibly put matlab codes in here from my MECE 5397 homework.
